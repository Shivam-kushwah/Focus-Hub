## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Flutter SDK installed.
* A free Azure account to get API keys.
* A Microsoft 365 / Outlook account for testing.

### Installation

1.  **Register your application in the Azure Portal.**
    * This is a crucial step to get the `Client ID` and `Tenant ID` required for authentication.
    * Ensure you grant the necessary API permissions in the portal: `User.Read`, `Calendars.Read`, `Tasks.ReadWrite`, and `Notes.ReadWrite`.

2.  **Clone the repository.**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/focus-hub.git](https://github.com/your_username/focus-hub.git)
    ```

3.  **Create a configuration file for your secrets.**
    * In the `lib/services/` directory, create a new file named `config.dart`.
    * Add your credentials to this file. This file should **NOT** be committed to Git.

    ```dart
    // lib/services/config.dart
    class AppConfig {
      static const String tenantId = 'YOUR_TENANT_ID_HERE';
      static const String clientId = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE';
    }
    ```
    * Make sure to add `/lib/services/config.dart` to your `.gitignore` file.

4.  **Install dependencies.**
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

5.  **Run the app.**
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```
